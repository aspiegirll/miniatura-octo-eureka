    Exo (Korean: 엑소; RR: ekso; stylized in all caps) is a South Korean-Chinese boy band based in Seoul formed by SM
    Entertainment in 2011 and debuted in 2012. The group consists of nine members: Xiumin, Suho, Lay, Baekhyun, Chen,
    Chanyeol, D.O., Kai and Sehun. They are noted for releasing music and performing extensively in Korean, Mandarin and
    Japanese.

    The group debuted with twelve members separated into Exo-K (Suho, Baekhyun, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai and Sehun) and Exo-M
    (Xiumin, Lay, Chen, Kris, Luhan and Tao). Members Kris, Luhan, and Tao departed the group individually amid legal
    battles with SM Entertainment in 2014 and 2015. Exo-K and Exo-M performed music in Korean and Mandarin,
    respectively, until the release of their third EP Overdose in 2014. Since then, Exo have exclusively performed as
    one group, although their music continues to feature multiple languages. Members Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin debuted
    in the sub-unit Exo-CBX in 2016, and members Sehun and Chanyeol began promoting as the sub-unit Exo-SC in 2019. Each
    member also maintains solo careers in music, film and television.

    Exo's first studio album XOXO (2013), released alongside breakthrough single "Growl", was received positively by
    critics and sold over one million copies, making Exo the first Korean act to do so in twelve years. The group's
    later works expanded on their early commercial success, with their subsequent Korean studio albums each selling over
    one million copies. Exo's sixth studio album, Don't Mess Up My Tempo (2018), became their highest-charting album on
    the US Billboard 200, debuting at number 23, and their best selling album in South Korea, where it sold over 1.9
    million copies. </li>
